# RailShooter

[This project was created and programmed with a help of a Unity Course.](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/)

## Basics learned

* How to create terrain with the help of the terrain tool
* About textures,`Bump Map`, `Height Map` and `Normal Map`
* How to create custom skybox (6 sided)
* How to keep instances of objects from scenes that isn't loaded anymore. Ex: A music player created in scene 1 will be destroyed in scene 2.
  - For that i used:
  [Object.DontDestroyOnLoad](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.DontDestroyOnLoad.html)
  [MonoBehaviour.Awake](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.Awake.html)

Happy coding :)!
